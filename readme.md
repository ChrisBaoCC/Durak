# Durak

## 27 July Update

This project is being shelved indefinitely in view of the sheer complexity of the program and the lack of manpower (i.e., only I am working on it). It may be revisited in the future, but for now the repository will stay online.

A personal project for education and entertainment ... edutainment?

*Durak* is a multiplayer card game ([more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak)) that I'm creating an app version for. The aim is to rid one's hand of all cards; the last one left with cards in their hands is *durak* ("fool" in Russian).

## Planned features

- Client-server capability
- Multiplayer — up to 6 people may join
- All-custom art and assets
